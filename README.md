# Tic Tac Toe - Android

An Android app to play Tic Tac Toe. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the following:
- Model-View-Intent Architecture: MVI could be understood as MVVM + State Management following Redux principles.
- Reactive Programming using LiveData + View Binding.
- Clean Software Architecture: Domain or Business Logic layer (Tic Tac Toe game logic in this case) is completely decoupled from View layer.
- Domain Layer Unit Tests. Game logic is tested thoroughly.
- Tic Tac Toe Game Logic that works for boards of any size (not just 3x3).

### Next steps
- Implement Reactive Paradigm using Flow + Jetpack Compose.
- Implement feature to manage scores. This will demonstrate the implementation of Data layer to store scores.
- Implement custom View for Tic Tac Toe Board.
- Improve game experience by implementing animations.
